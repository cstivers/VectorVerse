# STAT431-Project-3

The function in our VectorVerse package, called VoronoiVerse, is a function that 
generates a Voronoi diagram, which is made by creating a partition of a plane, and
filling in the resulting objects in the plane with chosen colors. The parameters
the user can set are the colors used, and the number of colors used, the number of
points to generate in the grid (defaulted to 100), the number of random seed points,
or sections, to generate (defaulted to 20), and the color palette of the diagram.
In the attached screenshot is a diagram generated with 100 grid points, 10 seed points,
and with the colors red, yellow, and turquoise.
